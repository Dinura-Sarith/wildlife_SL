    "head1": "The Sri Lankan Leopard",
    "p1": "Sri Lanka boasts some of the world's most stunning leopards, known as Panthera Pardus Kotiya. Their striking spots and mesmerizing gaze will leave you in awe if you are lucky enough to spot one during a jeep safari.Since 2020, the Sri Lankan leopard has been listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List, as the population is estimated at less than 800 mature individuals, and is probably declining.The Sri Lankan leopard has a tawny or rusty yellow coat with dark spots and close-set rosettes.The Sri Lankan leopard has possibly evolved to become a rather large leopard subspecies, because it is the apex predator in the country. Large males have been suggested to reach almost 100 kg (220 lb), but evidence for this is lacking.",

    "head3": "Yala national park",
    "p3": "Yala National Park is known as the best place to sight lepoards in Sri Lanka.This Is because Yala has the highest density of leopoerds of anywhere on the island.However,this statistic means that the park often has a highe density tourists in peak seasons from December to March.However, with five different zones to be explorded, it is possible to find quiet corners of the parks.Yala is comprised of dry grass fields,arid scrubland, and pockets of jungle.And also Sloth bears ,elephants and crocodiles also can be found here.",
    "head4": "Wilpattu national park",
    "p4": "Home to all kinds of animals and trees, the Wilpattu National Park covers an area of 1,317 square kilometres, making it the largest national park in the country. However, unlike Yala, which welcomes crowds of tourists with its famed leopard sightings, this national park is less than frequented—but that does not mean that your chances of spotting leopards are zero.<br>Not many travellers choose a jeep safari at Wilpattu due to logistic issues. In fact, its neighbouring region of Anuradhapura is not on the typical tourist itinerary, and the park itself is situated further away from the usual tourist route. But that is what makes it so perfect for introverts and for those who would like to enjoy the beauty of nature away from the crowds.",
    "head5": "Kumana national park",
    "p5": "When you are on wildlife safari in Kumana National Park watch out for elephants, spotted, and sambhur deer and of course the magnificent leopard. You will have to have keen eyes to spot the leopards lying in the undergrowth of the forest. They too are quite active around watering holes like the Kumana Villu swamp. Sometimes if you are lucky you will find one or twoleopards cross the roads in front of your safari jeeps as they hunt for their next meal.",
    "head6": "Threats faced by the Sri Lankan Leopard",
    "head7": "1.Habitat Fragmentation and Poaching",
    "p7": "In an attempt to feed the ever growing human population, forest habitats are being converted into farmlands. Farmers often blame leopards for loss of their livestock and often resort to retaliatory killings. Attempts to poison the carcass, use of snares, traps, electrocution are carried out to kill these predators.<br>Illegal hunting or poaching is also common in Asia. The skin and other body parts fetch a high price at international wildlife markets which make these animals susceptible to poaching.",
    "head8": "2.Human-Leopard Conflict",
    "p8": "The rapid expansion of urban areas worldwide has been markedly increasing the frequency of encounters humans have with wildlife and large carnivores such as leopards being no exception. Especially in densely populated countries of Asia, where half of the world’s population reside, sometimes in close proximity to wildlife reserves, there is an intense competition over natural resources.<br>Due to habitat fragmentation, protected areas are unable to contain leopards, who have extensive home ranges and are likely to stray out. As a result they come in contact with human dominated landscapes and are prone to increased interactions with humans. Crops such as sugar cane, tea plantations and other tall crops are involved in providing an “ideal” habitat for the leopard, allowing it to wander at close proximity to humans.",
